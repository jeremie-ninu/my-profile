			 	<p> As a second-year student at the IESEG school of management, I am currently learning to code thanks to Le Wagon and so far, it's been a great learning experience. In my free time, I like to travel ✈️ and I'm very interested in e-sports 🎮 and chess ♟.</p>

			 	<h2>Traveling ✈️</h2>
			 	<p>
			 	  I have traveled all my life, so it is an important part of me. I have lived in 3 different countries and have visited over 35. I love discovering new cultures, meeting new people, and visiting incredible places around the world.

			    <h2>E-sport 🎮</h2>
			 	<p>
			 	 As said previously, i lived in 3 countries and as a child i remember having rough times the first months after my arrival. So the video games helped me go through these times and now even if I can't play as much as before, I still wath the competitions and stay posted with the latest news.

			    <h2>Chess ♟</h2>
			 	<p>
			 	When I think of the immense number of possibilities that a chessboard offers, it fascinates me. Every game looks the same but is actually very different. It's a game of adaptation and strategy that allows me to escape for the duration of a game, concentrating only on the chessboard. By doing this, I manage to totally forget the rest of my thoughts and these short chess games, anodyne for some, become for me a short moment during which I manage to escape reality.
